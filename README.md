# snakegame
Simple OOP Snake game written in Python.

## Usage

This project was made mostly for the OOP design, however, there is a driver.

This driver can be run using Python 3.8.10. There are no secondary requirements (see [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)). 
However, it does depend on unix 'clear' and an ANSI-compliant terminal.

Running is as simple as `python3 main.py` or `./main.py`.
