# snakegame
Simple OOP Snake game written in Python.

## Usage

This project was made mostly for the OOP design, however, there is a driver.
This driver can be run using Python 3.8.10. There are no secondary requirements (see [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)).
However, it does depend on unix 'clear' and a unix-like terminal.
